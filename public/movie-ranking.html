<h1>The Best Movies According To Mary</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Movies Of All Time</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Coraline</h3>
<p>This is one of my favorite movies because it gives me coziness in the darkness</p>
<h3>Alice In Wonderland (Tim Burton) </h3>
<p>This interpertation of Alice is so aesthetically beautiful </p>
<h3> My Neighbor Totoro </h3>
<p>This is my favorite Miyazaki film but honestly it was quite hard to choose</p>
